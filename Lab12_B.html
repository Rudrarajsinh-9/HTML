        Yes. Feeling of trying things for the first time is ..it's just amazing. It is ineffable.

        They say "You are young as long as you have your first times'.
        
        Experiencing the first snowfall
        First flight
        First date with the crush.
        That crazy dance in the rain
        Trying out the new dress you just bought.
        Roller-Coaster ride
        First day of the school
        First kiss
        Saying I love you for the first time.
        That first sip of alcohol
        Free fall
        Feeling of having the first child
        WOW! All of these experiences are crazy and it's difficult to explain that joyous feeling!
        
        Make your every first time memorable!
